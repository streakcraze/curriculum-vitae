					<h2>COVER LETTER</h2>
					<p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p>
					<p>
						I am a 2nd year student pursuing electronics and computer
						engineering at Jomo Kenyatta University and I wish to apply for
						attachment. It is a requirement that I spend 2 months in an industry
						that is related to my field of study prior to joining the next year
						programme.
					</p>
					<p>
						As indicated in my CV, I have been learning about electronics and
						computing principles for the past two years of study. I require the
						industry setting to put the principles into work and enhance my
						learning. Your organization is very suitable to me through my area
						of interest and the location in Nairobi.
					</p>
					<p>
						I shall be most grateful if my application is considered favorably.
					</p>
					<p>Sincerely,</p>
					<p>Obiero, Arnold Odhiambo.</p>
